# Project Bismuth

this is teh beginig of the Project Bismuth (temporary name?). wihch will be an game.
right now there is not much to show besides pure idea 


### Idea
terraia + rainworld
it will be take "open world" and sandbox elements from terraria and living world with custom creatures like in rainworld 

## What's done right now
not much i'm still thinking about what tech to use and what systems i want i'm 70% sure i want to go bear bones
and, write it from scratch in odin but it may cahnge. 
right now i'm creating my own riging solution in godot, ah yes i will probaly use godot for prototyping well 
at least until i get basic framework done in odin.

### Why not Godot then? 
naturally you can ask why not godot. you arleady make stuff in it so why not make full game in it.
well i got few issues with it that may or may not be stupid: 
1. want to learn how to build stuff without using some big framework 
2. godot kinda sucks:
    there is an lot of small issues that prevent it from being something i want to use for bigger game.
    So i won't go into detail in here maybe other time 
3. more low level more control - especially over graphics
