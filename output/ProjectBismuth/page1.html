		<h1>Project Bismuth</h1>
<p>this is teh beginig of the Project Bismuth (temporary name?). wihch will be an game.
right now there is not much to show besides pure idea</p>
<h3>Idea</h3>
<p>terraia + rainworld
it will be take &quot;open world&quot; and sandbox elements from terraria and living world with custom creatures like in rainworld</p>
<h2>What's done right now</h2>
<p>not much i'm still thinking about what tech to use and what systems i want i'm 70% sure i want to go bear bones
and, write it from scratch in odin but it may cahnge.
right now i'm creating my own riging solution in godot, ah yes i will probaly use godot for prototyping well
at least until i get basic framework done in odin.</p>
<h3>Why not Godot then?</h3>
<p>naturally you can ask why not godot. you arleady make stuff in it so why not make full game in it.
well i got few issues with it that may or may not be stupid:</p>
<ol>
<li>want to learn how to build stuff without using some big framework</li>
<li>godot kinda sucks:
there is an lot of small issues that prevent it from being something i want to use for bigger game.
So i won't go into detail in here maybe other time</li>
<li>more low level more control - especially over graphics</li>
</ol>
